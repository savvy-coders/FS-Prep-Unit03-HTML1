  <!-- Instructions: First, change the title of the page within the title tag to be "My First HTML Project". You can test if this worked by hitting the green "Run" button, then clicking on the page icon with an arrow pointing up and right; it's there at the top right corner of the "emulated browser window" to the right -->

  <!-- Instructions: Create an HTML "div" element, apply a class called "container", and an id called "divOne" -->


  <!-- Instructions: Create an HTML "h1" element and set the text content to "Hello, World!" -->


  <!-- Instructions: Create an HTML "p" element and set the text content to "This is my first coding project using HTML!" -->


  <!-- Instructions: Create an HTML "img" element and set the "src" attribute to "image.jpg" -->


  <!-- Instructions: Create an HTML "a" element and set the "href" attribute to "https://replit.com/@savvy-coders" and the content (the text the user sees corresponding with that link) should be "Savvy Coders on Replit, where I'm learning to code!" -->


  <!-- Instructions: Create an HTML "form" element and set the "action" attribute to "submit". It won't do anything for now, because that form submission needs JavaScript to work, and also because we haven't really dug into form fields very deeply yet. For now, we're just practicing the syntax! -->
