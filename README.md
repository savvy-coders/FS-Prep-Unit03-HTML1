# Welcome to the code portion of the Intro to Web Dev Fundamentals Course

## Overview

Welcome to the Intro to Web Dev Fundamentals Course! This course will provide you with a solid foundation in web development concepts and skills. Throughout the curriculum, you will regularly be directed to this GitHub Classroom project and others to complete coding projects in a real web-hosted developer environment. This README.md file will guide you through the primary functionality and basics of using GitHub Classroom for coding practice in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

If you're just now stumbling upon this through GitHub, may I suggest signing up for the full course? We have quite a bit of supporting material over in our new virtual classroom hosted on GitHub. You can check that out here:

Also... weirded out by all the characters? I know. It looks odd. This is referred to as "Markdown" language, which is a special kind of text file that contains certain text character markup which tells the browser things about how to display it. Don't worry, we cover it a bit in the full bootcamp, but as it's really only used in development for producing informational files like this, we won't worry about it in our coding practice for now.
