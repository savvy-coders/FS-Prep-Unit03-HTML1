# Welcome to the code portion of the Intro to Web Dev Fundamentals Course!

## Overview
Welcome to the Intro to Web Dev Fundamentals Course! This course will provide you with a solid foundation in web development concepts and skills. Throughout the curriculum, you will regularly be directed to this Replit project and others to complete coding projects in a real web-hosted developer environment. This README.md file will guide you through the primary functionality and basics of using Replit for coding practice in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

If you're just now stumbling upon this through Replit, may I suggest signing up for the full course? We have quite a bit of supporting material over in our Google Classroom. You can check that out here:

Also... weirded out by all the characters? I know. It looks odd. This is referred to as "Markdown" language, which is a special kind of text file which contains certain text character markup which tells the browser things about how to display it. We can denote relative text and heading sizes and styles and even a bit of behavior (like in the case of links) using this dynamic syntax. Don't worry, we cover it a bit in the full bootcamp, but as it's really only used in development for producing informational files like this, we won't worry about it in our coding practice for now.

### IDE and Replit Basics
Replit is an online Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that provides a web-based coding environment where you can write, run, and test your code. Here are some key features and functionalities of Replit that you'll be using throughout this course:

#### Code Editor
- The code editor is the central area of the Replit interface where you will write your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.
- You can create new files or open existing ones using the file explorer on the left sidebar.
- The code editor provides syntax highlighting, auto-indentation, and other helpful features to enhance your coding experience.

#### Running and Testing Code
- To run your code, you can click on the green "Run" button located at the top of the Replit interface. This will execute your code and display the output in the console.
- If you're working on an HTML file, you can also click on the "Open in New Tab" button to open the emulated browser window and see your HTML page rendered.

#### Console
- The console panel displays the output of your JavaScript code and any error messages or debugging information.
- To view the console, click on the "Console" tab at the bottom of the Replit interface.
- You can use console.log() statements in your JavaScript code to output information and debug your programs.

#### Project Navigation
- In the file explorer on the left sidebar, you can navigate through your project files and folders.
- If a file or folder is collapsed, you can click on it to expand its contents.
- You can also create new files or folders using the "+" button in the file explorer.

#### Keyboard Shortcuts
- Replit provides several keyboard shortcuts to help you navigate and perform actions more efficiently. You can find a list of available shortcuts by clicking on the question mark icon at the top right corner of the Replit interface and selecting "Keyboard Shortcuts."

### Troubleshooting and Assistance
- If you accidentally close a window or need to find a specific panel, you can use the menu options at the top of the Replit interface. For example, you can go to "View" and select "Find File" to search for a specific file or folder.
- If you encounter any issues or have questions while using Replit, you can refer to the Replit documentation and help resources available on their website.
- Additionally, don't hesitate to reach out to your instructor or classmates for assistance or clarification.

Now that you have a basic understanding of Replit and its functionalities, you're ready to dive into the exciting world of web development! In the upcoming sections of this course, you will explore HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build dynamic and interactive web applications.

Happy coding and enjoy your learning journey!
